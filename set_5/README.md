##Crypto Challenge Set 5
This is the first set of __number-theoretic cryptography__ challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is __significantly harder__ than the last set. The concepts are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous sets, and... math.

On the other hand, __our favorite cryptanalytic attack ever__ is in this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp out here. You're almost done!
